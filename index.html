        <p class="lead mb-4">About me: I was born in Shanghai, China in February of 2001 and moved to Encinitas, California in March of 2003. For elementary school, I attended Park Dale Lane Elementary in Encinitas and for middle school, I attended the Army Navy Academy in Carlsbad (California) while for high school, I went to La Costa Canyon High School, also in Carlsbad. I have an older sister and two dogs, one is a Schnauzer and the other is a Havanese. Growing up in Encinitas, I spent a lot of time outdoors, either at the beach or on hiking trails. My hobbies when I was younger included Playstation 3, skateboarding, and frequent fishing trips to the pond. For sports, I played both basketball and soccer, excelling in both. However, by high school, I had decided to focus more on soccer and quit basketball as the two sports were becoming extremely time consuming when combined. I played soccer for both club and school, playing for varsity and competitive teams.<br><br>

        I am currently in college at the University of California, Riverside. Majoring in Political Science, I plan to either head in the direction of law or criminology yet am open to any prominent opportunities in the future. While in college, I have gained an appreciation for computer science, especially coding and computer programming. I have also developed a liking for microwavable-food and microwaves in general while in college. At the moment, I am currently conducting my undergraduate studies yet plan on seeking a higher degree.<br><br>

        Regarding work experience, much of what I have done has taken place in athletic environments. As a former high school athlete, I was exposed to a lot of sports and decided to gain employment in a setting in which I felt both comfortable and knowledgeable. My first job, which I still have, hired me in 2014 as an Official Cal South Youth Sports Referee, Grade 9. That job included officiating youth competitive soccer for both boys and girls, tasking me with ensuring player safety and development. Since 2014, I have constantly refereed at various tournaments and have reached a new certification level of Grade 7. On top of that, I officiated youth sports at the Magdalena Ecke Family Y.M.C.A. since 2018 where I would also officiate childrenâ€™s sports.
